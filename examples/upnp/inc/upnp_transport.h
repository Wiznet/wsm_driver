 * Network seam for the UPnP client.
 *
 * upnp_core.c reaches the network exclusively through this header and knows
 * nothing about sockets, lwIP, or the WIZnet chip. Only upnp_transport.c
 * includes lwIP.
 *
 * That also settled a collision the original had: UPnP.c carried its own
 * inet_addr / inet_ntoa / htons / htonl / ntohs / ntohl with signatures that
 * disagree with lwIP's. Because this seam takes addresses as strings, none of
 * them are reachable any more and they are gone rather than renamed.
 *
 * The seam sits at the level of whole exchanges rather than individual socket
 * calls. The original code opened a socket, spun on getSn_SR() until the chip
 * reported SOCK_INIT, connected, spun again for SOCK_ESTABLISHED, sent, polled
 * the receive register, and closed -- six chip-specific steps for what is one
 * request/response. None of those states exist in BSD sockets, so mapping the
 * calls one-to-one would have meant inventing them. Collapsing each exchange
 * into a single entry point removes them instead.
 *
 * `ops` is deliberately a const void * rather than a net_sock_ops_t *: that
 * type is an anonymous typedef with no struct tag, so it cannot be forward
 * declared, and naming it here would drag the component's headers -- and lwIP
 * behind them -- back into upnp_core.c.
